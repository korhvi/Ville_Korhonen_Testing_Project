> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Testing the GitLab web application provided a challenging experience. The unconventional approach of testing before having clear requirements mirrored real-world challenges. Typically, testing aligns with predefined requirements, making this approach a unique learning opportunity.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- The test case writing process involved navigating through the web application, noting outcomes, and documenting steps. Positive test cases were straightforward, while negative cases required creative thinking. The process was managed using VS Code, enabling continuous commits to GitHub for version control.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - While .txt files were used for this project, recommendations include avoiding .txt for ease of tab adjustments. An ideal tool should provide easy-to-update templates, and Jira is suggested for its compatibility with Agile Software Development.   


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- VS Code served as the preferred IDE for editing files and tracking changes on GitHub. Familiarity with Eclipse, NetBeans, Visual Studio Code, and Notepad++ for Java and web development demonstrates versatility in tool usage.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- Encountering conflicts with email addresses for GitLab and GitHub highlighted the importance of resolving issues promptly. GitHub, a well-utilized platform, facilitated version control, although a brief conflict resolution was required.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- Lacking automation experience, the preference for automation tools will align with workplace choices. Robot Framework is a potential candidate due to its popularity, ease of use, and compatibility with existing test cases.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- Job search results emphasize the demand for experience, technical skills in Python, C++, C#, and automation frameworks like Robot Framework. Additional skills include familiarity with Git, GitLab, Jira, and Agile methodologies.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- To pursue a testing career, gaining experience is crucial. Learning Robot Framework, automation frameworks, and enhancing scripting skills (e.g., Bash, Python, C++) are essential. Soft skills include critical thinking and familiarity with Agile practices.



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- The course presented challenges, especially with extensive memorization for quizzes. The theoretical aspects felt disconnected until applied in test scenarios. The need for progression beyond introductory courses was highlighted, advocating for earlier exposure to automation.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- First-time GitLab usage required adaptation, and test case writing provided a logical process. The project reinforced theoretical knowledge but raised questions about proper syntax usage in test scenarios.
